As some of you may have heard, this will be the last New Years and possibly even the last proper party at the Vasey house. We want to start the new year and mark the end of an era with a bang.

We want to provide everything you need to get pleasantly tipsy (or roaring drunk) and to have an amazing party. We have worked out what we need and how much this will cost, but it would be really awesome if you guys could help us out!

Just to make it clear, this is non-compulsory. Even if you decide not to contribute at all, this stuff is still for you, feel free to enjoy all the free booze and other festivities.
